I know this might be the most weird way to approach this but anyway ðŸ˜£. Am weird most times.
This is where my shyness has led me to but anyway I tried to bring this is up the best way I could.
I am freaking out that one day this episode me and you have will blow up in my face or both our faces.
I don't want to come in between you and Mulei but I kinda feel like I am betray one of my closest friends.
That is you and your guy. If it helps I might stop drinking with you guys just to be on the safe side.
I know I should have just said this face to face but well this is how reserved I am at saying some things.
This is the weird ðŸ˜£ but yeah. I know it was the alcohol but deep down I don't think it's right to put you in
some situations. Anyway forget I ever did this.
I don't know how to self-destruct a message for now so you can delete it after you read it. For safe-keeping.
